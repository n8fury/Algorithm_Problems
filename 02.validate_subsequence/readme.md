# Problem Statement

The problem is Validating subsequences.
We can call a sequence, a subsequence if it is a subset of another sequence and derived by deleting some of the members of the main sequence but keeping the order.

```
A = [0,1,5,6,8,9,-1,-,4-,7]
B = [6,8,9,-1,-7]
```
We can see that B is array which is formed by deleting some of the members of A but the order is maintained. So, we can say that, B is a subsequence of A.

In the problem two non empty arrays will be given. we have to find out if the second array is a subsequence of the first array or not.
