# Description

This repository contains all the answers to Algoexpert's 160 coding interview questions.
The purpose of this repository is to overcome my algorithmic problems.

The question will be answered by difficulty. That means I will start from the easiest problems and work my way to the most complex problems.

I will use python as my preferable question, and each answer will be inside a separate folder.
