# Tournament Winner

## <u><i><b>Problem Statement</b></i></u>

Two Arrays will be given.
One contains the contestants and the other contains the results of the matches.

```
competitions = [
  ["Harvard", "MIT"],
  ["MIT", "Stanford"],
  ["Harvard", "Stanford"],
]
results = [0, 1, 1]
```

The result array dictates the winner of the corresponding competition. 0 denotes the Away team won and 1 denotes the Home team won. For example in the above example, MIT beat Harvard, MIT  beat Stanford and Stanford beat Harvard. So the winner is MIT.
We have to create a function which can determine the winner team from the given arrays.
